0	6900	So I grew up in a suburban town in the US and there is a type of house in
6900	15120	suburbia that we refer to as a McMansion. Now McMansions are really big
15120	19920	houses that try to look like multi-million dollar mansions without
19920	25600	the cost of millions of dollars having gone into build the actual house. I always
25600	33520	thought of McMansions they're ugly they look kind of tacky they're not really my
33520	40760	vibe. McMansions are usually mass produced houses so they all look similar
40760	45960	to each other and because they're built with quantity in mind over quality they
45960	52000	have a lot of characteristics that I don't really think makes sense and I
52000	62560	don't know anything about architecture or building houses. Personally McMansions
62560	70360	aren't really my style they lack the personality I think that regular mansions
70360	77440	have and because they're built in neighborhoods with other houses like
77440	87340	very close by they also lack the privacy that regular mansions would have
87340	99360	with big big yards and lots of land to kind of like maintain privacy and so
99400	108000	that lack of privacy I think also makes the house not feel as luxurious as a
108000	111720	regular mansion would.
