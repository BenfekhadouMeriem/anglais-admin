0	5840	Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent
5840	13000	English speakers so that you can use them too. I'm Feifei and I'm joined by a very colourful
13000	14000	Georgie.
14000	18720	Yes, I'm wearing all the colours of the rainbow today. I definitely feel like I'm having a
18720	22000	bit of a main character moment in the office.
22000	28000	And main character moment is the expression we're looking at in this programme. Now, we
28000	33360	know main character in the usual sense. It's the person, animal or fictional being that
33360	38440	a story centres around, often the most important character in a story.
38440	44160	Exactly. But in the last few years, people on the internet have been using main character
44160	49520	to describe real people. If you call someone the main character, it just means they stand
49520	52200	out or grab people's attention in some way.
52200	57880	And yes, you definitely look like the main character today in that very colourful outfit
57880	63800	Georgie. Now, having a main character moment is when you feel like the protagonist of
63800	69560	a film. Maybe because you're wearing something eccentric or something about your environment
69560	71400	or situation is dramatic.
71400	76680	Yes, so for example, I remember when I was little, being in the car with my parents and
76680	83040	I was looking out the window at the raindrops falling down the window and feeling very dramatic.
83040	86960	I was having a real main character moment. Let's hear some more examples.
88880	97000	Yesterday, I got my hair, my nails, my makeup done. I felt great walking down the street.
97000	99400	It was such a main character moment.
99400	104000	I had a main character moment at the weekend. I played a board game with my friends and
104000	109440	I delivered such a motivating speech to my teammates. I felt really cool.
109440	115560	So we went out with colleagues recently and I did a dance solo in the middle of the dance
115600	120680	floor. Everyone was watching and cheering. It was such a main character moment.
124800	130840	As you heard, main character moment is mostly used to describe positive situations. You
130840	134400	wouldn't use it when something negative is happening to you.
134400	140400	Yes. Now, another expression you might hear is main character energy. You could say someone
140400	145240	gives off main character energy and it means they're showing confidence and charisma that
145240	147720	a main protagonist in a film might have.
147720	152760	Yes. You are giving off big main character energy today, Georgie.
152760	159000	Wow, Feifei. So many compliments. OK, let's recap. We learned a main character moment,
159000	162520	which is what happens when you feel like the protagonist of a film.
