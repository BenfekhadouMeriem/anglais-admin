I live in Queens in New York City in a townhouse and it is a three-story house with a basement.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.920
The basement is kind of its own little apartment.

00:22.920 --> 00:29.680
There's a bed and a kitchen and a bathroom and we have our laundry down there and that's

00:29.680 --> 00:37.920
basically where we keep most of our old things that we don't want to throw away.

00:37.920 --> 00:49.040
And then on the first floor we have our regular kitchen and our dining room and our living

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
room.

00:50.040 --> 01:05.200
So there are three rooms that are separated by walls but not by doors, they're separated

01:05.200 --> 01:07.960
by a curtain.

01:07.960 --> 01:16.240
And then on the second floor are all the kids' bedrooms and the library.

01:16.240 --> 01:27.640
So we have my bedroom and my sisters, two of my sisters share a bedroom and we have

01:27.640 --> 01:38.360
our own bathroom which has a shower in it and a sink and a bathtub and a toilet.

01:38.360 --> 01:47.440
And then we also have the library on the second floor where we just have everybody's books

01:47.440 --> 01:50.800
and a nice cozy reading area.

01:50.800 --> 01:57.040
And then on the third floor there are also three rooms.

01:57.040 --> 02:02.200
There's another kitchen on the third floor, it's much smaller because it used to be another

02:02.200 --> 02:05.680
apartment as well.

02:05.680 --> 02:13.880
And it's my stepfather's office and then my parents' bedroom and then my little brother

02:13.880 --> 02:20.720
has a small bedroom next to my parents' bedroom.
