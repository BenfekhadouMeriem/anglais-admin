from 10 5 to 11 it is so fun after that from 11 to 11.55 we have music then we
have lunch from 11.55 to 1.10 after lunch from 1.10 to 2.5 we have French and to
finish off the day we have Spanish I also like Wednesdays because from 1.10
to 2.5 we have art that is one of my very favorite classes I don't really
like Tuesdays because there isn't any of my favorite classes and we have to
start the day off with math thank you for listening bye
