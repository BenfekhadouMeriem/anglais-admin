0	7400	Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States.
7400	12640	It celebrates the time when the pilgrims came from Europe
12640	15560	and gave thanks to the Native Americans
15560	21480	for helping them gather food and have a great meal
21480	24640	after their long trip.
24640	30240	Thanksgiving in my family is really wonderful.
30240	32440	We get together.
32440	35600	Everyone in the family comes to my house,
35600	40320	including my cousins and my aunts and uncles.
40320	44720	And we have a very, very, very large meal
44720	49080	in the middle of the day at around 5 p.m.
49080	52560	And it's the only meal of the day.
52560	56080	It's really nice because everyone comes together early
56080	61320	in the day and starts cooking together.
61320	66680	The main part of the Thanksgiving meal is the turkey.
66680	70960	And it's a lot of fun creating all of the things
70960	75200	that accompany the turkey, including the stuffing, which
75200	82840	usually is made of rice and spices.
82840	87440	And then there's the cranberry sauce,
87440	90080	which is very popular for Thanksgiving meals.
95200	97920	And there is, of course, a lot of corn
97920	100520	because corn is something that is
100520	104280	native to the United States.
