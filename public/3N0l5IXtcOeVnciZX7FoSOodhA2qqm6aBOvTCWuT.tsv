0	5000	Are women and men equal in the workplace?
5000	17000	I don't think they are, but I probably don't think that it will ever be possible either
17000	28000	because a man and a woman aren't necessarily interested in the same things as men.
28000	38000	They have different interests, like in jobs.
38000	45000	For example, if you look at the degrees people do at uni,
45000	55000	you have some subjects that have the majority will be men and others the majority will be women.
55000	62000	No one's forced them to do that subject, that's just what they're interested in.
62000	72000	I also think that maybe women will always have different priorities.
72000	79000	There is always the fact that women, they want children,
79000	87000	they are the ones who have to give birth and have to take time off work.
87000	106000	Unfortunately, I don't think that women can be equal to men because of that huge fact.
106000	128000	Also, there's another fact that when women don't have kids and they are ruthless in the workplace,
128000	136000	they're then said that they're then compared to a man, which I find quite unfair.
136000	149000	A lot of women feel that they have to act that way, to be promoted and to do very well for themselves.
150000	158000	I do still think there is discrimination to some extent as well.
158000	164000	Also, women are paid less, so that's another discrimination.
