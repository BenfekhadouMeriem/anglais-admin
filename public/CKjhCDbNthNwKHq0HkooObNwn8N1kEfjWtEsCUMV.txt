In my handbag I have a lot of cards, basically I have many different debit and credit cards
in my bag as well as a lot of identification, I'm always very scared that I'm going to lose
one or I'm going to have to identify myself and I won't be able to identify myself.
So I have my high school ID, I have my college ID, I have my Greek government ID, I have
my driver's license from New York, I have my state ID from New York, I have my student
like government ID from Chicago, I have so many forms of identification in my bag.
