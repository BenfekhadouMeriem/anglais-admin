1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
I live in Queens in New York City in a townhouse and it is a three-story house with a basement.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,920
The basement is kind of its own little apartment.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,680
There's a bed and a kitchen and a bathroom and we have our laundry down there and that's

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,920
basically where we keep most of our old things that we don't want to throw away.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:49,040
And then on the first floor we have our regular kitchen and our dining room and our living

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
room.

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:01:05,200
So there are three rooms that are separated by walls but not by doors, they're separated

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,960
by a curtain.

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:16,240
And then on the second floor are all the kids' bedrooms and the library.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:27,640
So we have my bedroom and my sisters, two of my sisters share a bedroom and we have

11
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:38,360
our own bathroom which has a shower in it and a sink and a bathtub and a toilet.

12
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:47,440
And then we also have the library on the second floor where we just have everybody's books

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,800
and a nice cozy reading area.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,040
And then on the third floor there are also three rooms.

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,200
There's another kitchen on the third floor, it's much smaller because it used to be another

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,680
apartment as well.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,880
And it's my stepfather's office and then my parents' bedroom and then my little brother

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,720
has a small bedroom next to my parents' bedroom.
