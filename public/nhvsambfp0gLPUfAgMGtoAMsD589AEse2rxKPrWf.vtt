00:00.000 --> 00:06.900
So I grew up in a suburban town in the US and there is a type of house in

00:06.900 --> 00:15.120
suburbia that we refer to as a McMansion. Now McMansions are really big

00:15.120 --> 00:19.920
houses that try to look like multi-million dollar mansions without

00:19.920 --> 00:25.600
the cost of millions of dollars having gone into build the actual house. I always

00:25.600 --> 00:33.520
thought of McMansions they're ugly they look kind of tacky they're not really my

00:33.520 --> 00:40.760
vibe. McMansions are usually mass produced houses so they all look similar

00:40.760 --> 00:45.960
to each other and because they're built with quantity in mind over quality they

00:45.960 --> 00:52.000
have a lot of characteristics that I don't really think makes sense and I

00:52.000 --> 01:02.560
don't know anything about architecture or building houses. Personally McMansions

01:02.560 --> 01:10.360
aren't really my style they lack the personality I think that regular mansions

01:10.360 --> 01:17.440
have and because they're built in neighborhoods with other houses like

01:17.440 --> 01:27.340
very close by they also lack the privacy that regular mansions would have

01:27.340 --> 01:39.360
with big big yards and lots of land to kind of like maintain privacy and so

01:39.400 --> 01:48.000
that lack of privacy I think also makes the house not feel as luxurious as a

01:48.000 --> 01:51.720
regular mansion would.
