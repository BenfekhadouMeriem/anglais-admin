Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,000
English speakers so that you can use them too. I'm Feifei and I'm joined by a very colourful

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Georgie.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Yes, I'm wearing all the colours of the rainbow today. I definitely feel like I'm having a

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000
bit of a main character moment in the office.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And main character moment is the expression we're looking at in this programme. Now, we

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,360
know main character in the usual sense. It's the person, animal or fictional being that

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,440
a story centres around, often the most important character in a story.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Exactly. But in the last few years, people on the internet have been using main character

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,520
to describe real people. If you call someone the main character, it just means they stand

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,200
out or grab people's attention in some way.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,880
And yes, you definitely look like the main character today in that very colourful outfit

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,800
Georgie. Now, having a main character moment is when you feel like the protagonist of

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,560
a film. Maybe because you're wearing something eccentric or something about your environment

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,400
or situation is dramatic.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,680
Yes, so for example, I remember when I was little, being in the car with my parents and

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,040
I was looking out the window at the raindrops falling down the window and feeling very dramatic.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,960
I was having a real main character moment. Let's hear some more examples.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,000
Yesterday, I got my hair, my nails, my makeup done. I felt great walking down the street.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
It was such a main character moment.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,000
I had a main character moment at the weekend. I played a board game with my friends and

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,440
I delivered such a motivating speech to my teammates. I felt really cool.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,560
So we went out with colleagues recently and I did a dance solo in the middle of the dance

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,680
floor. Everyone was watching and cheering. It was such a main character moment.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,840
As you heard, main character moment is mostly used to describe positive situations. You

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,400
wouldn't use it when something negative is happening to you.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes. Now, another expression you might hear is main character energy. You could say someone

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,240
gives off main character energy and it means they're showing confidence and charisma that

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
a main protagonist in a film might have.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes. You are giving off big main character energy today, Georgie.

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,000
Wow, Feifei. So many compliments. OK, let's recap. We learned a main character moment,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,520
which is what happens when you feel like the protagonist of a film.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,120
And thanks for joining us.

41

Amazingly, the cottage is made out of sweets and cakes.

42
