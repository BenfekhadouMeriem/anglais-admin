0	18360	I live in Queens in New York City in a townhouse and it is a three-story house with a basement.
18360	22920	The basement is kind of its own little apartment.
22920	29680	There's a bed and a kitchen and a bathroom and we have our laundry down there and that's
29680	37920	basically where we keep most of our old things that we don't want to throw away.
37920	49040	And then on the first floor we have our regular kitchen and our dining room and our living
49040	50040	room.
50040	65200	So there are three rooms that are separated by walls but not by doors, they're separated
65200	67960	by a curtain.
67960	76240	And then on the second floor are all the kids' bedrooms and the library.
76240	87640	So we have my bedroom and my sisters, two of my sisters share a bedroom and we have
87640	98360	our own bathroom which has a shower in it and a sink and a bathtub and a toilet.
98360	107440	And then we also have the library on the second floor where we just have everybody's books
107440	110800	and a nice cozy reading area.
110800	117040	And then on the third floor there are also three rooms.
117040	122200	There's another kitchen on the third floor, it's much smaller because it used to be another
122200	125680	apartment as well.
125680	133880	And it's my stepfather's office and then my parents' bedroom and then my little brother
133880	140720	has a small bedroom next to my parents' bedroom.
