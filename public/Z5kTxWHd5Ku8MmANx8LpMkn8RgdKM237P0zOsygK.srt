00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Are women and men equal in the workplace?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't think they are, but I probably don't think that it will ever be possible either

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because a man and a woman aren't necessarily interested in the same things as men.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They have different interests, like in jobs.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For example, if you look at the degrees people do at uni,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you have some subjects that have the majority will be men and others the majority will be women.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No one's forced them to do that subject, that's just what they're interested in.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I also think that maybe women will always have different priorities.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is always the fact that women, they want children,

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
they are the ones who have to give birth and have to take time off work.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Unfortunately, I don't think that women can be equal to men because of that huge fact.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Also, there's another fact that when women don't have kids and they are ruthless in the workplace,

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
they're then said that they're then compared to a man, which I find quite unfair.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A lot of women feel that they have to act that way, to be promoted and to do very well for themselves.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I do still think there is discrimination to some extent as well.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Also, women are paid less, so that's another discrimination.
