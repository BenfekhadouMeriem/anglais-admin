00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.640
It celebrates the time when the pilgrims came from Europe

00:12.640 --> 00:15.560
and gave thanks to the Native Americans

00:15.560 --> 00:21.480
for helping them gather food and have a great meal

00:21.480 --> 00:24.640
after their long trip.

00:24.640 --> 00:30.240
Thanksgiving in my family is really wonderful.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.440
We get together.

00:32.440 --> 00:35.600
Everyone in the family comes to my house,

00:35.600 --> 00:40.320
including my cousins and my aunts and uncles.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.720
And we have a very, very, very large meal

00:44.720 --> 00:49.080
in the middle of the day at around 5 p.m.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.560
And it's the only meal of the day.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.080
It's really nice because everyone comes together early

00:56.080 --> 01:01.320
in the day and starts cooking together.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.680
The main part of the Thanksgiving meal is the turkey.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.960
And it's a lot of fun creating all of the things

01:10.960 --> 01:15.200
that accompany the turkey, including the stuffing, which

01:15.200 --> 01:22.840
usually is made of rice and spices.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.440
And then there's the cranberry sauce,

01:27.440 --> 01:30.080
which is very popular for Thanksgiving meals.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.920
And there is, of course, a lot of corn

01:37.920 --> 01:40.520
because corn is something that is

01:40.520 --> 01:44.280
native to the United States.
