0	4720	Hello! Thanks for listening to the Learning English Conversations podcast.
4720	7920	This next episode is part of our music series,
7920	13360	My Song, My Home, where we learn language from a different song each week.
13360	18000	In each episode we visit a different city and meet a new musician.
18000	21600	It's a great way to practice listening to real English speakers
21600	25520	and you'll learn lots of English expressions from the music in the program.
25520	28320	We hope you enjoy it!
28320	32560	It's it's got such a musical history, the city, obviously you've got the Beatles
32560	35920	but there are so many other amazing bands that have come from here,
35920	40000	that there's so much music coming out of Liverpool.
40000	44080	We're in an old library with wooden shelves full of old books
44080	47600	and huge bright windows in the centre of Liverpool,
47600	50480	a city in the northwest of England.
50480	58240	My name is Grace Chloe, I am a singer and pianist and songwriter.
58240	62960	Like Grace says, Liverpool is probably most famous for being the home of the
62960	67280	rock band The Beatles, who became famous in the 1960s.
67280	70880	But there's a lot more to see.
73200	78800	Welcome to My Song, My Home. In this podcast we visit a different place in
78800	82160	each episode and meet a musician that lives there.
82160	86240	Today, Grace will explain why she decided to become a musician
86240	91680	and tell us about living in Liverpool. We'll also learn some vocabulary from
91680	96480	her music later in the program. Find a transcript of this episode to
96480	102080	read along on our website bbclearningenglish.com
102640	108960	Grace has always had an interest in music.
108960	112960	I knew like every word to every song that was on the radio,
112960	116960	all the sort of old songs and the new songs I'd always be singing along.
116960	121040	If we went to a restaurant, I'd sit there with my headphones in,
121040	125360	singing out loud, annoying people at other tables.
125760	131840	Grace has been singing as long as she can remember,
131840	135680	and she began playing the piano as a child.
135680	141120	I lost my eyesight when I was four, so I had to learn to read braille and stuff
141120	146640	like that. And it was the first time I'd ever heard a song like this.
146640	150640	I was a child, and I didn't know how to read it.
150640	156240	I didn't know when stuff like that, and it was the
156240	160240	mobility teacher, so the person that sort of taught me how to use a long cane and
160240	164480	stuff. They suggested that learning the piano
164480	169280	could improve my sense of touch and my strength in my
169280	174720	hands and my wrists and stuff. Grace is blind and had to learn to read braille.
174720	178480	This is a system for reading for people without eyesight,
178480	182640	where small bumps can be read by running your fingers across the page.
182640	186080	Because Grace had to learn to use touch for reading braille,
186080	189440	a teacher suggested learning the piano might help.
189440	193520	I started playing it for those reasons, but then just
193520	198880	as soon as I started, I absolutely realised how much I absolutely loved it.
199280	210080	Music quickly became a huge part of Grace's life,
210080	214000	and she began to love performing when she got a chance to sing on stage
214000	218320	at a festival. There was a group there called Rocky Oki,
218320	225840	and they're basically a live band karaoke band. Rocky Oki is a play on the word
225840	230400	karaoke, which is where just the music but not the voice of a popular song is
230400	233440	played so that you can sing along yourself. This
233440	238720	version was with a live band, and Grace got picked to sing.
238720	243520	I just remember the second I opened my mouth, the
243520	247840	tent of people just went absolutely crazy. By the end of the song
247840	252720	everyone was singing, there were people sort of running in from outside,
252720	258720	and when I finished, the crowd started chanting, saying one more song.
258720	263440	When Grace performed, the crowd started chanting, repeating the same words.
263440	268320	One more song. From that moment, Grace wanted to be a musician.
268320	273280	Yeah, it nearly makes me cry talking about it. It was just such an incredible feeling,
273280	276640	and it was sort of, that was the first time I really
276640	282080	knew deep down that I would never want to do anything other than music.
282080	285600	So Grace moved to Liverpool to study music at the university,
285600	296720	and it has quickly become home. It is the friendliest, scariest,
296720	303120	most off-the-wall, lovely, absolutely bananas place in the world.
303120	306160	The people here are the loveliest people you will meet
306160	310080	anywhere. Grace describes Liverpool as off-the-wall
310080	316080	or unusual, and bananas very silly. It's also been a great place for Grace to
316080	319120	write and perform.
320480	325040	Grace is going to perform her song Perplexed. Have a listen and visit our
325040	328240	website to read the lyrics.
340240	345440	You say you're back and I can't quite believe you see your eyes, in your eyes,
345440	350000	behind the green, and don't understand what's going on.
350000	353200	Oh God, I'm feeling that something is wrong.
353200	358000	I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some
358000	361360	straight up talking, I need some understanding.
361360	364240	Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,
364320	367440	and I can't get no answers from you.
367440	375040	No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.
375040	382160	I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.
382160	388000	I can't believe I had anxiety that I couldn't love you as much as you love
388000	391600	me, but three months on didn't seem so long,
391600	395680	and yeah, our positions have completely swung.
395680	402000	I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me,
402000	408240	begging for you out your feet, begging just like the tide had me down on my knees.
408240	413040	I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some
413040	416480	straight up talking, I need some understanding.
416480	419360	Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,
419360	422560	and I can't get no answers from you.
422560	430320	No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.
430320	434400	I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.
434400	439680	The song is called Perplexed because Grace wanted to include this strange word in a song.
439680	444400	Perplexed means confused because something is too difficult to understand.
444400	447840	You might be perplexed by a maths problem for example,
447840	453200	but in the song Grace is perplexed by a relationship with somebody.
453200	457600	In the song Grace uses the phrase, worship the ground you walk on.
457600	461360	I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me.
461360	466160	It's a common expression in English, it means to love or admire someone a lot,
466160	469840	so much so that the things they've touched, like the ground they've walked on,
469840	474720	become special. In the song Grace uses the phrase, straight up talking.
474720	479440	I'm lost with you babe, don't keep saying we're great, it's time we did some
479440	484880	straight up talking. Straight in this context means honest or truthful,
484880	488240	straight up talking means an honest conversation.
488240	492240	You can also be a straight talker, which is someone who tells the truth
492240	496400	even if it's difficult. One of the lyrics in the song is
496400	502960	reading between the subtext. I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.
502960	506960	Now this is a playful take on a common English expression,
506960	511120	reading between the lines. If you read between the lines you try to
511120	515920	understand meanings or emotions that are not literally in the words on a page or
515920	519680	that someone has said. This hidden meaning can also be called a
519680	523360	subtext, so if you were reading between the subtext,
523360	527600	like Grace does in the song, you would be looking for an even more hidden
527600	532080	meaning, maybe one that isn't even there. In the song it's about being
532080	535840	confused about a relationship and looking for answers.
535840	539760	Listen to the rest of Grace's song and read along using the lyrics on our
539760	543360	website. Are there any other phrases she uses about
543360	546880	being confused or perplexed?
562080	566720	Are you never nothing, nothing at all?
566720	575200	Oh yes, at that point, I'm with you, I guess that feels safe now, I feel small.
575200	582560	I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying the big, great.
582560	586000	Lost with you, babe, can't keep nothing, smiling.
586080	589360	Oh yeah, we're okay.
589360	592640	I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying we're great.
592640	595920	It's time we did some straight up talking.
595920	599280	I need some understanding, don't know where we're standing,
599280	604080	don't know where we're at, and I can't get no answers from you.
604080	612000	No, you know it's true, and the lines are who you say to.
612080	618320	I'm missing the subject, got me perplexed.
