Are women and men equal in the workplace?

00:05.000 --> 00:17.000
I don't think they are, but I probably don't think that it will ever be possible either

00:17.000 --> 00:28.000
because a man and a woman aren't necessarily interested in the same things as men.

00:28.000 --> 00:38.000
They have different interests, like in jobs.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
For example, if you look at the degrees people do at uni,

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
you have some subjects that have the majority will be men and others the majority will be women.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
No one's forced them to do that subject, that's just what they're interested in.

01:02.000 --> 01:12.000
I also think that maybe women will always have different priorities.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
There is always the fact that women, they want children,

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
they are the ones who have to give birth and have to take time off work.

01:27.000 --> 01:46.000
Unfortunately, I don't think that women can be equal to men because of that huge fact.

01:46.000 --> 02:08.000
Also, there's another fact that when women don't have kids and they are ruthless in the workplace,

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
they're then said that they're then compared to a man, which I find quite unfair.

02:16.000 --> 02:29.000
A lot of women feel that they have to act that way, to be promoted and to do very well for themselves.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
I do still think there is discrimination to some extent as well.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
Also, women are paid less, so that's another discrimination.
