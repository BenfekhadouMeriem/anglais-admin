Hello! Thanks for listening to the Learning English Conversations podcast.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.920
This next episode is part of our music series,

00:07.920 --> 00:13.360
My Song, My Home, where we learn language from a different song each week.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.000
In each episode we visit a different city and meet a new musician.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.600
It's a great way to practice listening to real English speakers

00:21.600 --> 00:25.520
and you'll learn lots of English expressions from the music in the program.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.320
We hope you enjoy it!

00:28.320 --> 00:32.560
It's it's got such a musical history, the city, obviously you've got the Beatles

00:32.560 --> 00:35.920
but there are so many other amazing bands that have come from here,

00:35.920 --> 00:40.000
that there's so much music coming out of Liverpool.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.080
We're in an old library with wooden shelves full of old books

00:44.080 --> 00:47.600
and huge bright windows in the centre of Liverpool,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.480
a city in the northwest of England.

00:50.480 --> 00:58.240
My name is Grace Chloe, I am a singer and pianist and songwriter.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.960
Like Grace says, Liverpool is probably most famous for being the home of the

01:02.960 --> 01:07.280
rock band The Beatles, who became famous in the 1960s.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.880
But there's a lot more to see.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.800
Welcome to My Song, My Home. In this podcast we visit a different place in

01:18.800 --> 01:22.160
each episode and meet a musician that lives there.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.240
Today, Grace will explain why she decided to become a musician

01:26.240 --> 01:31.680
and tell us about living in Liverpool. We'll also learn some vocabulary from

01:31.680 --> 01:36.480
her music later in the program. Find a transcript of this episode to

01:36.480 --> 01:42.080
read along on our website bbclearningenglish.com

01:42.640 --> 01:48.960
Grace has always had an interest in music.

01:48.960 --> 01:52.960
I knew like every word to every song that was on the radio,

01:52.960 --> 01:56.960
all the sort of old songs and the new songs I'd always be singing along.

01:56.960 --> 02:01.040
If we went to a restaurant, I'd sit there with my headphones in,

02:01.040 --> 02:05.360
singing out loud, annoying people at other tables.

02:05.760 --> 02:11.840
Grace has been singing as long as she can remember,

02:11.840 --> 02:15.680
and she began playing the piano as a child.

02:15.680 --> 02:21.120
I lost my eyesight when I was four, so I had to learn to read braille and stuff

02:21.120 --> 02:26.640
like that. And it was the first time I'd ever heard a song like this.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.640
I was a child, and I didn't know how to read it.

02:30.640 --> 02:36.240
I didn't know when stuff like that, and it was the

02:36.240 --> 02:40.240
mobility teacher, so the person that sort of taught me how to use a long cane and

02:40.240 --> 02:44.480
stuff. They suggested that learning the piano

02:44.480 --> 02:49.280
could improve my sense of touch and my strength in my

02:49.280 --> 02:54.720
hands and my wrists and stuff. Grace is blind and had to learn to read braille.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.480
This is a system for reading for people without eyesight,

02:58.480 --> 03:02.640
where small bumps can be read by running your fingers across the page.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.080
Because Grace had to learn to use touch for reading braille,

03:06.080 --> 03:09.440
a teacher suggested learning the piano might help.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.520
I started playing it for those reasons, but then just

03:13.520 --> 03:18.880
as soon as I started, I absolutely realised how much I absolutely loved it.

03:19.280 --> 03:30.080
Music quickly became a huge part of Grace's life,

03:30.080 --> 03:34.000
and she began to love performing when she got a chance to sing on stage

03:34.000 --> 03:38.320
at a festival. There was a group there called Rocky Oki,

03:38.320 --> 03:45.840
and they're basically a live band karaoke band. Rocky Oki is a play on the word

03:45.840 --> 03:50.400
karaoke, which is where just the music but not the voice of a popular song is

03:50.400 --> 03:53.440
played so that you can sing along yourself. This

03:53.440 --> 03:58.720
version was with a live band, and Grace got picked to sing.

03:58.720 --> 04:03.520
I just remember the second I opened my mouth, the

04:03.520 --> 04:07.840
tent of people just went absolutely crazy. By the end of the song

04:07.840 --> 04:12.720
everyone was singing, there were people sort of running in from outside,

04:12.720 --> 04:18.720
and when I finished, the crowd started chanting, saying one more song.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.440
When Grace performed, the crowd started chanting, repeating the same words.

04:23.440 --> 04:28.320
One more song. From that moment, Grace wanted to be a musician.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.280
Yeah, it nearly makes me cry talking about it. It was just such an incredible feeling,

04:33.280 --> 04:36.640
and it was sort of, that was the first time I really

04:36.640 --> 04:42.080
knew deep down that I would never want to do anything other than music.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.600
So Grace moved to Liverpool to study music at the university,

04:45.600 --> 04:56.720
and it has quickly become home. It is the friendliest, scariest,

04:56.720 --> 05:03.120
most off-the-wall, lovely, absolutely bananas place in the world.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.160
The people here are the loveliest people you will meet

05:06.160 --> 05:10.080
anywhere. Grace describes Liverpool as off-the-wall

05:10.080 --> 05:16.080
or unusual, and bananas very silly. It's also been a great place for Grace to

05:16.080 --> 05:19.120
write and perform.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.040
Grace is going to perform her song Perplexed. Have a listen and visit our

05:25.040 --> 05:28.240
website to read the lyrics.

05:40.240 --> 05:45.440
You say you're back and I can't quite believe you see your eyes, in your eyes,

05:45.440 --> 05:50.000
behind the green, and don't understand what's going on.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.200
Oh God, I'm feeling that something is wrong.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.000
I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some

05:58.000 --> 06:01.360
straight up talking, I need some understanding.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.240
Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,

06:04.320 --> 06:07.440
and I can't get no answers from you.

06:07.440 --> 06:15.040
No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.

06:15.040 --> 06:22.160
I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

06:22.160 --> 06:28.000
I can't believe I had anxiety that I couldn't love you as much as you love

06:28.000 --> 06:31.600
me, but three months on didn't seem so long,

06:31.600 --> 06:35.680
and yeah, our positions have completely swung.

06:35.680 --> 06:42.000
I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me,

06:42.000 --> 06:48.240
begging for you out your feet, begging just like the tide had me down on my knees.

06:48.240 --> 06:53.040
I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some

06:53.040 --> 06:56.480
straight up talking, I need some understanding.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.360
Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,

06:59.360 --> 07:02.560
and I can't get no answers from you.

07:02.560 --> 07:10.320
No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.400
I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.680
The song is called Perplexed because Grace wanted to include this strange word in a song.

07:19.680 --> 07:24.400
Perplexed means confused because something is too difficult to understand.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.840
You might be perplexed by a maths problem for example,

07:27.840 --> 07:33.200
but in the song Grace is perplexed by a relationship with somebody.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.600
In the song Grace uses the phrase, worship the ground you walk on.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.360
I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me.

07:41.360 --> 07:46.160
It's a common expression in English, it means to love or admire someone a lot,

07:46.160 --> 07:49.840
so much so that the things they've touched, like the ground they've walked on,

07:49.840 --> 07:54.720
become special. In the song Grace uses the phrase, straight up talking.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.440
I'm lost with you babe, don't keep saying we're great, it's time we did some

07:59.440 --> 08:04.880
straight up talking. Straight in this context means honest or truthful,

08:04.880 --> 08:08.240
straight up talking means an honest conversation.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.240
You can also be a straight talker, which is someone who tells the truth

08:12.240 --> 08:16.400
even if it's difficult. One of the lyrics in the song is

08:16.400 --> 08:22.960
reading between the subtext. I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.960
Now this is a playful take on a common English expression,

08:26.960 --> 08:31.120
reading between the lines. If you read between the lines you try to

08:31.120 --> 08:35.920
understand meanings or emotions that are not literally in the words on a page or

08:35.920 --> 08:39.680
that someone has said. This hidden meaning can also be called a

08:39.680 --> 08:43.360
subtext, so if you were reading between the subtext,

08:43.360 --> 08:47.600
like Grace does in the song, you would be looking for an even more hidden

08:47.600 --> 08:52.080
meaning, maybe one that isn't even there. In the song it's about being

08:52.080 --> 08:55.840
confused about a relationship and looking for answers.

08:55.840 --> 08:59.760
Listen to the rest of Grace's song and read along using the lyrics on our

08:59.760 --> 09:03.360
website. Are there any other phrases she uses about

09:03.360 --> 09:06.880
being confused or perplexed?

09:22.080 --> 09:26.720
Are you never nothing, nothing at all?

09:26.720 --> 09:35.200
Oh yes, at that point, I'm with you, I guess that feels safe now, I feel small.

09:35.200 --> 09:42.560
I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying the big, great.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.000
Lost with you, babe, can't keep nothing, smiling.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.360
Oh yeah, we're okay.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.640
I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying we're great.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.920
It's time we did some straight up talking.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.280
I need some understanding, don't know where we're standing,

09:59.280 --> 10:04.080
don't know where we're at, and I can't get no answers from you.

10:04.080 --> 10:12.000
No, you know it's true, and the lines are who you say to.

10:12.080 --> 10:18.320
I'm missing the subject, got me perplexed.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.720
