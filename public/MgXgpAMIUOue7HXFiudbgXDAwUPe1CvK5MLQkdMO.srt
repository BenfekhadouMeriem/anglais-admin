1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,640
It celebrates the time when the pilgrims came from Europe

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,560
and gave thanks to the Native Americans

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,480
for helping them gather food and have a great meal

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,640
after their long trip.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,240
Thanksgiving in my family is really wonderful.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,440
We get together.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,600
Everyone in the family comes to my house,

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
including my cousins and my aunts and uncles.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,720
And we have a very, very, very large meal

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,080
in the middle of the day at around 5 p.m.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,560
And it's the only meal of the day.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
It's really nice because everyone comes together early

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,320
in the day and starts cooking together.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,680
The main part of the Thanksgiving meal is the turkey.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,960
And it's a lot of fun creating all of the things

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
that accompany the turkey, including the stuffing, which

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,840
usually is made of rice and spices.

19
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,440
And then there's the cranberry sauce,

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,080
which is very popular for Thanksgiving meals.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
And there is, of course, a lot of corn

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,520
because corn is something that is

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,280
native to the United States.
