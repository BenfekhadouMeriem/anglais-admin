Hello, and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent

00:05.840 --> 00:13.000
English speakers so that you can use them too. I'm Feifei and I'm joined by a very colourful

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Georgie.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.720
Yes, I'm wearing all the colours of the rainbow today. I definitely feel like I'm having a

00:18.720 --> 00:22.000
bit of a main character moment in the office.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
And main character moment is the expression we're looking at in this programme. Now, we

00:28.000 --> 00:33.360
know main character in the usual sense. It's the person, animal or fictional being that

00:33.360 --> 00:38.440
a story centres around, often the most important character in a story.

00:38.440 --> 00:44.160
Exactly. But in the last few years, people on the internet have been using main character

00:44.160 --> 00:49.520
to describe real people. If you call someone the main character, it just means they stand

00:49.520 --> 00:52.200
out or grab people's attention in some way.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.880
And yes, you definitely look like the main character today in that very colourful outfit

00:57.880 --> 01:03.800
Georgie. Now, having a main character moment is when you feel like the protagonist of

01:03.800 --> 01:09.560
a film. Maybe because you're wearing something eccentric or something about your environment

01:09.560 --> 01:11.400
or situation is dramatic.

01:11.400 --> 01:16.680
Yes, so for example, I remember when I was little, being in the car with my parents and

01:16.680 --> 01:23.040
I was looking out the window at the raindrops falling down the window and feeling very dramatic.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.960
I was having a real main character moment. Let's hear some more examples.

01:28.880 --> 01:37.000
Yesterday, I got my hair, my nails, my makeup done. I felt great walking down the street.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.400
It was such a main character moment.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.000
I had a main character moment at the weekend. I played a board game with my friends and

01:44.000 --> 01:49.440
I delivered such a motivating speech to my teammates. I felt really cool.

01:49.440 --> 01:55.560
So we went out with colleagues recently and I did a dance solo in the middle of the dance

01:55.600 --> 02:00.680
floor. Everyone was watching and cheering. It was such a main character moment.

02:04.800 --> 02:10.840
As you heard, main character moment is mostly used to describe positive situations. You

02:10.840 --> 02:14.400
wouldn't use it when something negative is happening to you.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.400
Yes. Now, another expression you might hear is main character energy. You could say someone

02:20.400 --> 02:25.240
gives off main character energy and it means they're showing confidence and charisma that

02:25.240 --> 02:27.720
a main protagonist in a film might have.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.760
Yes. You are giving off big main character energy today, Georgie.

02:32.760 --> 02:39.000
Wow, Feifei. So many compliments. OK, let's recap. We learned a main character moment,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.520
which is what happens when you feel like the protagonist of a film.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.120
And thanks for joining us.

02:44.120 --> 02:44.680
Bye.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.560
Bye.

Amazingly, the cottage is made out of sweets and cakes.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.160
But his biggest idea is to bring a dead body to life.
