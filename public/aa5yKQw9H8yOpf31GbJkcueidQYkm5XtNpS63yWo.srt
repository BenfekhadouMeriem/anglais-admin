00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello! Thanks for listening to the Learning English Conversations podcast.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,920
This next episode is part of our music series,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,360
My Song, My Home, where we learn language from a different song each week.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,000
In each episode we visit a different city and meet a new musician.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,600
It's a great way to practice listening to real English speakers

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,520
and you'll learn lots of English expressions from the music in the program.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,320
We hope you enjoy it!

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,560
It's it's got such a musical history, the city, obviously you've got the Beatles

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,920
but there are so many other amazing bands that have come from here,

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
that there's so much music coming out of Liverpool.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,080
We're in an old library with wooden shelves full of old books

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,600
and huge bright windows in the centre of Liverpool,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
a city in the northwest of England.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,240
My name is Grace Chloe, I am a singer and pianist and songwriter.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Like Grace says, Liverpool is probably most famous for being the home of the

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
rock band The Beatles, who became famous in the 1960s.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,880
But there's a lot more to see.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Welcome to My Song, My Home. In this podcast we visit a different place in

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,160
each episode and meet a musician that lives there.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,240
Today, Grace will explain why she decided to become a musician

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,680
and tell us about living in Liverpool. We'll also learn some vocabulary from

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,480
her music later in the program. Find a transcript of this episode to

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,080
read along on our website bbclearningenglish.com

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,960
Grace has always had an interest in music.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
I knew like every word to every song that was on the radio,

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
all the sort of old songs and the new songs I'd always be singing along.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
If we went to a restaurant, I'd sit there with my headphones in,

28
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
singing out loud, annoying people at other tables.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,840
Grace has been singing as long as she can remember,

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
and she began playing the piano as a child.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,120
I lost my eyesight when I was four, so I had to learn to read braille and stuff

32
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,640
like that. And it was the first time I'd ever heard a song like this.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,640
I was a child, and I didn't know how to read it.

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,240
I didn't know when stuff like that, and it was the

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,240
mobility teacher, so the person that sort of taught me how to use a long cane and

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,480
stuff. They suggested that learning the piano

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,280
could improve my sense of touch and my strength in my

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,720
hands and my wrists and stuff. Grace is blind and had to learn to read braille.

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
This is a system for reading for people without eyesight,

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,640
where small bumps can be read by running your fingers across the page.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,080
Because Grace had to learn to use touch for reading braille,

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
a teacher suggested learning the piano might help.

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,520
I started playing it for those reasons, but then just

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,880
as soon as I started, I absolutely realised how much I absolutely loved it.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:30,080
Music quickly became a huge part of Grace's life,

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
and she began to love performing when she got a chance to sing on stage

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,320
at a festival. There was a group there called Rocky Oki,

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,840
and they're basically a live band karaoke band. Rocky Oki is a play on the word

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,400
karaoke, which is where just the music but not the voice of a popular song is

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,440
played so that you can sing along yourself. This

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,720
version was with a live band, and Grace got picked to sing.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,520
I just remember the second I opened my mouth, the

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,840
tent of people just went absolutely crazy. By the end of the song

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
everyone was singing, there were people sort of running in from outside,

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,720
and when I finished, the crowd started chanting, saying one more song.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
When Grace performed, the crowd started chanting, repeating the same words.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,320
One more song. From that moment, Grace wanted to be a musician.

58
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Yeah, it nearly makes me cry talking about it. It was just such an incredible feeling,

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,640
and it was sort of, that was the first time I really

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,080
knew deep down that I would never want to do anything other than music.

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
So Grace moved to Liverpool to study music at the university,

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:56,720
and it has quickly become home. It is the friendliest, scariest,

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,120
most off-the-wall, lovely, absolutely bananas place in the world.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
The people here are the loveliest people you will meet

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
anywhere. Grace describes Liverpool as off-the-wall

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,080
or unusual, and bananas very silly. It's also been a great place for Grace to

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
write and perform.

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Grace is going to perform her song Perplexed. Have a listen and visit our

69
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
website to read the lyrics.

70
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,440
You say you're back and I can't quite believe you see your eyes, in your eyes,

71
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,000
behind the green, and don't understand what's going on.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh God, I'm feeling that something is wrong.

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
straight up talking, I need some understanding.

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,440
and I can't get no answers from you.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,040
No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.

78
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,160
I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

79
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't believe I had anxiety that I couldn't love you as much as you love

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,600
me, but three months on didn't seem so long,

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
and yeah, our positions have completely swung.

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,000
I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me,

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,240
begging for you out your feet, begging just like the tide had me down on my knees.

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,040
I'm lost with you, babe, God keeps saying we're great, it's time we did some

85
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,480
straight up talking, I need some understanding.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,360
Don't know where we're standing, don't know where we're at,

87
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
and I can't get no answers from you.

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,320
No, you know it's true, and no, I don't hear what you say too.

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,400
I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,680
The song is called Perplexed because Grace wanted to include this strange word in a song.

91
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
Perplexed means confused because something is too difficult to understand.

92
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
You might be perplexed by a maths problem for example,

93
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,200
but in the song Grace is perplexed by a relationship with somebody.

94
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,600
In the song Grace uses the phrase, worship the ground you walk on.

95
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,360
I worship the ground you walk on, you worship the ground behind me.

96
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,160
It's a common expression in English, it means to love or admire someone a lot,

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
so much so that the things they've touched, like the ground they've walked on,

98
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,720
become special. In the song Grace uses the phrase, straight up talking.

99
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm lost with you babe, don't keep saying we're great, it's time we did some

100
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,880
straight up talking. Straight in this context means honest or truthful,

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,240
straight up talking means an honest conversation.

102
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
You can also be a straight talker, which is someone who tells the truth

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
even if it's difficult. One of the lyrics in the song is

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,960
reading between the subtext. I've been in between the subjects, you've got me perplexed.

105
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Now this is a playful take on a common English expression,

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
reading between the lines. If you read between the lines you try to

107
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,920
understand meanings or emotions that are not literally in the words on a page or

108
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,680
that someone has said. This hidden meaning can also be called a

109
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,360
subtext, so if you were reading between the subtext,

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
like Grace does in the song, you would be looking for an even more hidden

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
meaning, maybe one that isn't even there. In the song it's about being

112
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,840
confused about a relationship and looking for answers.

113
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Listen to the rest of Grace's song and read along using the lyrics on our

114
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
website. Are there any other phrases she uses about

115
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,880
being confused or perplexed?

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Are you never nothing, nothing at all?

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:35,200
Oh yes, at that point, I'm with you, I guess that feels safe now, I feel small.

118
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying the big, great.

119
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
Lost with you, babe, can't keep nothing, smiling.

120
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
Oh yeah, we're okay.

121
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm lost with you, babe, can't keep saying we're great.

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
It's time we did some straight up talking.

123
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,280
I need some understanding, don't know where we're standing,

124
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,080
don't know where we're at, and I can't get no answers from you.

125
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:12,000
No, you know it's true, and the lines are who you say to.

126
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm missing the subject, got me perplexed.

127
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
Thanks for listening to My Song, My Home. You can watch Grace's performance
