Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent

00:05.880 --> 00:09.160
English speakers so that you can use them too.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.880
I'm Feifei and I'm here with Phil.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.720
You don't look happy today, Phil.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.280
No, I'm not.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.920
I've just been with the rest of the team.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.560
We're working on a project and they're just getting everything wrong.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.480
I tried to tell them exactly what they needed to do and what mistakes they were making and

00:27.480 --> 00:30.120
my words fell on stony ground.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.680
They fell on stony ground?

00:33.680 --> 00:39.240
Maybe your ideas weren't that good or you were being a bit rude, but let's have a look

00:39.240 --> 00:42.560
at the expression for on stony ground.

00:42.560 --> 00:49.840
Yes, we use it to say that a suggestion or idea is either unpopular or just ignored,

00:49.840 --> 00:51.640
like all my suggestions just now.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.600
Well, there's an image here.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.400
Think about seeds.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.680
If seeds are blown by the wind and fall on ground that has lots of stones, then they

01:00.680 --> 01:02.600
probably won't grow.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.040
They just die.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.760
Like your ideas, Phil.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.840
Don't remind me.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.880
It's often things that are unpopular that fall on stony ground.

01:10.880 --> 01:17.000
When a company announces a pay cut for their employees, it's likely to fall on stony ground.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.480
If you try to tell someone that their big idea probably isn't going to work, then there's

01:22.480 --> 01:26.560
a good chance that your warning will fall on stony ground.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.880
Let's hear some more examples of people using fall on stony ground.

01:31.880 --> 01:39.400
I told my son he needed to be home before dark on his bike.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.600
That fell on stony ground.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.520
He really wasn't happy.

01:42.520 --> 01:49.640
A school near me has banned smartphones and it's really fallen on stony ground.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.360
Everyone is annoyed.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.520
I really wanted to have a party for my birthday, but my suggestion fell on stony ground.

01:57.520 --> 02:02.560
Nobody wants to come.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.800
In the same way that we can use stony ground to talk about ideas not being well received,

02:08.800 --> 02:15.240
we can use fertile ground to describe a place where it is easy for ideas to develop.

02:15.240 --> 02:20.280
We could say that a good manager helps to create fertile ground for ideas.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.840
A successful university might be fertile ground for innovative research.

02:25.840 --> 02:31.000
We hope that this program is fertile ground for your English development.
