00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
So I grew up in a suburban town in the US and there is a type of house in

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:15,120
suburbia that we refer to as a McMansion. Now McMansions are really big

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
houses that try to look like multi-million dollar mansions without

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,600
the cost of millions of dollars having gone into build the actual house. I always

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,520
thought of McMansions they're ugly they look kind of tacky they're not really my

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,760
vibe. McMansions are usually mass produced houses so they all look similar

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,960
to each other and because they're built with quantity in mind over quality they

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,000
have a lot of characteristics that I don't really think makes sense and I

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,560
don't know anything about architecture or building houses. Personally McMansions

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,360
aren't really my style they lack the personality I think that regular mansions

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,440
have and because they're built in neighborhoods with other houses like

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:27,340
very close by they also lack the privacy that regular mansions would have

13
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:39,360
with big big yards and lots of land to kind of like maintain privacy and so

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:48,000
that lack of privacy I think also makes the house not feel as luxurious as a

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,720
regular mansion would.
