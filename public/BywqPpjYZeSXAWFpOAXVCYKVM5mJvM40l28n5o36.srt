Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,160
English speakers so that you can use them too.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm Feifei and I'm here with Phil.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,720
You don't look happy today, Phil.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,280
No, I'm not.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,920
I've just been with the rest of the team.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,560
We're working on a project and they're just getting everything wrong.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,480
I tried to tell them exactly what they needed to do and what mistakes they were making and

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,120
my words fell on stony ground.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,680
They fell on stony ground?

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,240
Maybe your ideas weren't that good or you were being a bit rude, but let's have a look

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,560
at the expression for on stony ground.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,840
Yes, we use it to say that a suggestion or idea is either unpopular or just ignored,

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
like all my suggestions just now.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,600
Well, there's an image here.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,400
Think about seeds.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,680
If seeds are blown by the wind and fall on ground that has lots of stones, then they

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,600
probably won't grow.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,040
They just die.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,760
Like your ideas, Phil.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,840
Don't remind me.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,880
It's often things that are unpopular that fall on stony ground.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,000
When a company announces a pay cut for their employees, it's likely to fall on stony ground.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,480
If you try to tell someone that their big idea probably isn't going to work, then there's

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,560
a good chance that your warning will fall on stony ground.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,880
Let's hear some more examples of people using fall on stony ground.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:39,400
I told my son he needed to be home before dark on his bike.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
That fell on stony ground.

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,520
He really wasn't happy.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,640
A school near me has banned smartphones and it's really fallen on stony ground.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,360
Everyone is annoyed.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,520
I really wanted to have a party for my birthday, but my suggestion fell on stony ground.

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
Nobody wants to come.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,800
In the same way that we can use stony ground to talk about ideas not being well received,

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,240
we can use fertile ground to describe a place where it is easy for ideas to develop.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,280
We could say that a good manager helps to create fertile ground for ideas.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,840
A successful university might be fertile ground for innovative research.

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,000
We hope that this program is fertile ground for your English development.
