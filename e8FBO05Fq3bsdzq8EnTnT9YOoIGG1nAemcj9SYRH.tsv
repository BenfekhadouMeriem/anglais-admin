0	5880	Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, where we explain expressions used by fluent
5880	9160	English speakers so that you can use them too.
9160	12880	I'm Feifei and I'm here with Phil.
12880	14720	You don't look happy today, Phil.
14720	16280	No, I'm not.
16280	17920	I've just been with the rest of the team.
17920	22560	We're working on a project and they're just getting everything wrong.
22560	27480	I tried to tell them exactly what they needed to do and what mistakes they were making and
27480	30120	my words fell on stony ground.
30120	33680	They fell on stony ground?
33680	39240	Maybe your ideas weren't that good or you were being a bit rude, but let's have a look
39240	42560	at the expression for on stony ground.
42560	49840	Yes, we use it to say that a suggestion or idea is either unpopular or just ignored,
49840	51640	like all my suggestions just now.
51640	53600	Well, there's an image here.
53600	55400	Think about seeds.
55400	60680	If seeds are blown by the wind and fall on ground that has lots of stones, then they
60680	62600	probably won't grow.
62600	64040	They just die.
64040	65760	Like your ideas, Phil.
65760	66840	Don't remind me.
66840	70880	It's often things that are unpopular that fall on stony ground.
70880	77000	When a company announces a pay cut for their employees, it's likely to fall on stony ground.
77000	82480	If you try to tell someone that their big idea probably isn't going to work, then there's
82480	86560	a good chance that your warning will fall on stony ground.
86560	91880	Let's hear some more examples of people using fall on stony ground.
91880	99400	I told my son he needed to be home before dark on his bike.

117520	122560	Nobody wants to come.
122560	128800	In the same way that we can use stony ground to talk about ideas not being well received,
128800	135240	we can use fertile ground to describe a place where it is easy for ideas to develop.
135240	140280	We could say that a good manager helps to create fertile ground for ideas.
